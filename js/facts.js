There are Two Different types of Budgies</h3>" + "<br /><button id='button2'>Toggle</button><br />" + "<h4 id='t2'>Most people never realise that now there are two distinct types of budgies: the Common Budgie that originates from Australia and the so called 'show budgie' the larger English Budgie which is bred in England specifically for shows and pet trades.
