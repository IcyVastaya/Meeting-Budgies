After countless generations of breeding, numerous other colored mutations appeared.<br /><br />New feather colorations that appeared in budgies are royal blue, sky blue, turquoise, grayish-blue, yellow (whole body), albino (whole white body) and violet as the rarest of them all. Royal blue are the most common after the original coloration, with their body being blue instead of green and head white instead of yellow. Sky blue is the same and royal blue just a bit less common. As for grayish-blue, instead of having black colored markings on their necks, head and wings, they are light gray instead.There are several combinations of these colors all put in together, making them having at least 4 to 5 different colors.<br /><br />Yellow and White are considered rarer than other colorations due recessive allele gene. As for Violet, they are considered the rarest mutation, appearing approximately 1 in every 30 budgie mutation.";
