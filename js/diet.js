document.getElementById("paragraphDiet").innerHTML = "<h2>Healthy Diet for your pet Bird</h2><br />" + "Most people that own a budgie think providing them only seeds is enough, which is highly incorrect. Feeding your budgie only seeds can get them 'hooked', meaning they will ignore any other type of food you offer. Having a seed only diet can lead to many health problems such and respiratory, liver disease and tumors.<br /><br />Variety is the key to a healthy diet since they eat diverse foods in the wild. Seeds can be a nutritious part of your budgie's diet, but because they are high in fat, they should only make a portion of the diet. Pelleted diets are also a good choice, but same as seeds, eating only that is also bad. Budgies also need to eat fresh vegetables such as carrots, corn, beans, broccoli, spinach, etc, and fruits.<br /><br />Your budgie might not want to start eating newely introduced food, so you need to be extremely patient, since new foods can scare them. Sprouted seeds are also an excellent way to add variety to your bird's diet but avocados, chocolate, sugar and salt must be avoided, since they are deadly to budgies. Cuttlebone should also be provided into your bird's cage, but eating too much of it can be harmful to your budgie.";
