If it's possible it's way better to buy a bird directly from a well known breeder since they are usually hand trained since they were younger, making them easier to tame than the pet store ones. Taming a budgie from a pet store is a bigger challange.<br /><br />Since budgies are active and playful, they should be provided with a large cage as their home that allows them room for toys, sleeping, eating and even flight. Horizontal cage types are way better than vertical ones, since budgies like to move horizontally around the cage. Even with all the right equipment for your budgie's cage, they will still need playtime and socialization outside of the cage. Flight time is very important for your bird, but keep in mind that you need to provide a safe area where he can fly without getting injured. Trimming your budgie's wings is also an option if he is exposed to getting injured while flying, but that can lead to your bird having lack of exercise.<br /><br />Since budgies are flock birds, they are always in need of a companion. It is said that Budgies seem to be happiest when kept in pairs. A single bird can be fine as long as you spend enough time interacting and playing with it on a daily basis. Free flying time is critical to the budgie. You should offer him several hours of flight each day in a safe room. Also, you should rotate toys in your budgie's cage monthly to prevent it from getting bored.";
