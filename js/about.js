I major in Software and Data Engineering in Singidunum University. This Website is the first one i've made since i started my studies here.<br />My goal for making this website was to give as much information as possible about adorable avian species called budgerigars, since they can make astonishing lifetime companions. Bonding with little birds can take time but it's defenitely worth every penny when you succeed!<br /><br />Hope you have a great time spending time reading my posts. Cheers!";
