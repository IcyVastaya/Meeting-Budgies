Being the first parrot species that was bred in captivity and one of the first pets, they remain popular even today around the world.<br /><br /> Since budgies are small in size, taking care of them makes it way easier than some other bigger parrot species. This makes them a way better option for those that prefer smaller species and those that lack time required to spend time and maintain larger birds. Also they are easier to clean after, again, because they are a smaller species. Also, they are way less expensive than others to maintain and feed due to their popularity and appetite, and they can easily be kept in smaller apartments. Although easier to maintain than other bird species, even they can make a mess, since they are 'messy' eaters, tossing food around. Despite their size, they have a big personality and are extremely smart and intelligent. They can be easily taught to talk and whistle like any other larger parrot species. Many people think they are less valuable as pets because of their size, which is wrong. They are parrots as any other way larger parrot species and can make a great addition to your family. They are full of personality, extremely playful and can bond with you like any other species.<br /><br /> To tame your budgie, you need to follow these steps: First few days after getting your budgie, you should only be close to the cage and reading a book for an example to make it get used to your voice. After that, yo should slowly start putting your hand near the cage step by step, but keep in mind that if you rush things your budgie will get scared. Make it so that each day you put your hand close to the cage by few centimetres. As your budgie starts to trust you more, try offering it a seed millet first from a distance and later try with your hand. After your budgie accepts your treats try to make it step up on your finger. If it works, you should try to introduce him to the outside of his cage. If it doesn't, go back a step behind and try again. That's all!";
