Also, the nomadic movements of the flocks are also in need of food and water. In Australia, budgies are mostly found in open woodlands, grasslands and scrublands. Their most common diet are spinifex seeds, grass seeds and ripening wheat. They occasionally eat vegetables and fruits if they get the chance.<br/ ><br />" + "<h3>Breeding</h3>" + "Breeding season generally takes place between June and January (June and Semptember in northern Australia, August and January in southern Australia). During breeding season they show signs of affection to their flockmates by preening and feeding each other. Budgies feed one another by eating the seeds themselved first and then giving it to their flockmate's mouth.<br /><br />Their Nests are made in holes in trees, fence posts or logs lying on the ground. In the wild, all parrot species require a hollow tree or log as a nest site. Bceuase of this antural behaviour, they most easily breed in captivity since they can be easily provided with reasonable-sized nest boxes. Females usually lay between 4 to 8 eggs, which she will incubate for about 21 days each. Females will not allow a male to enter the nest, unless he forces his way inside XD. Age difference between the first and last hatchling can be anywhere from 9 to 16 days.<br /><br />" + "<h3>Chick Health</h3>" + "There are many breeding difficulties that occur. There are cases of some chicks dying from diseases and attacks from adults. Also females may fight each other over the nest box. Most health issues in budgies are genetic. Budgies that are related, have fatty tumors or any other potentional genetic health problems should not be allowed to breed. Parasites and pathogens and contagious and thus transmitted between individuals through either direct or indirect contact. Nest boxes should be always cleaned between uses.<br /><br >Splay leg is a relatively common problem in baby budgies and in other birds. It means that one of budgie's legs is bent outward which prevents it from being able to stant properly thus inability to compete with other chicks for food. Also can lead to difficulties in reporducing in adulthood.<br /><br />" + "<h3>Behaviour</h3>" + "Budgies are social animals and require daily stimulation of different shapes of toys and interaction with other budgerigars and humans. Socialized budgies can be taught to speak, whistle and play with humans. It is said that males are more suited for singing and mimicry, but it all depends on the personality of the bird. Some females can talk, sing and mimic as good as males. Pet males, especially if kept alone and are tame, are generally the best speakers.<br /><br />" + "<h3>Lifespan</h3>" + "Budgies in captivity have an average lifespan of 5 up to 8 years, which is a consequence of poor lifestyle and eating habbits aka 'seed addiction'. It is reported that the can live up to 15-20 years if taken care of properly. Lifespan also depends on breeding and lineage.<br /><br />" + "<h3>Determing Budgerigar's Age</h3>" + "Figuring out budgie's age can be easy! You can tell if a budgie is a baby or an adult with these few signs!<br /><br />Young budgies have stripes and bars on the cap of their head that stretch all the way to the base of their upper beak. If your bird has these stripes it means it is less than 4 months old. There are some exceptions to this rule though because there are several mutations of budgies that don't have those stripes since birth!<br /><br />Also if your budgie has some brown-blackish colored melanin on their beak it means that your budgie is not older than 1-3 months! Color of their cere also indicates their age and also gender! If the budgie's cere is pink it means it's a young male, if it's while-blue it's a young female. If it's royal blue its an adult male and if it's brown it's an adult female.<br /><br />They can be identified by the color of their eyes too. Since baby budgies have not developed an iris yet, it also helps! If your bird's eyes are completely black it means your budgie is less than 5 months old. If it has a dark gray iris, it is about 4-8 months old. If their iris is ligher (light gray or brown) it means it's older than 8-12 months.";
