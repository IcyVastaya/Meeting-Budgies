document.getElementById("paragraphGender").innerHTML ="<h2>How to Determine Budgie's Gender?</h2><br />" + "Determing budgie's gender can be determined by the color of their cere (part of their body above their beaks.). It can be quite missleading since many people think it's blue for males and pink for females.<br /><br />Young male budgies have a pink color of their cere and some rare mutations (whole yellow and white - albino) contain a pink colored cere their whole lives. Other male budgies, upon reaching adulthood, have their cere change it's coloration from pink into royal blue.<br /><br />As for females, young females have a pale blue, almost white cere. As they reach adulthood they maintain that same color or some change to a pinkish-brown color. When it's a breeding season, their color changes to pure brown which returns to normal color when it ends.<br /><br />Coloration of their cere isn't the only factor determing your budgie's gender, although it is the most reliable. Their behaviour can also determine their gender. In general, males are more playful, vocal, sing way more and can mimic things way easier, unlike females that are more moody, prone to making 'angry' noises instead of singing and can rarely learn to talk. As i said, it depends on each bird individually, since there are known female budgies that can sing and mimic sounds as good as males.";
