They may be the smallest but according to statistics, they are and have been the most popular bird as a pet since they have been discovered and imported from Australia. Reason for that is due to a combination of their size, beautiful markings / colors of their plumage, playful nature, amazing talking abilities and the fact that they are way less expensive to maintain unlike other parrot species.<br /><br />These tiny avian species have been imported into Britain for the first time in 1840, and since then they have been successfully bred in captivity. Since their natural feather coloration is green and yellow with black scalloped marking on backs of their necks, wings and back, few mutations have occured adding blue, grayish-blue, yellow (whole body), white (albino) and turquoise colors to their feather coloration. Some of them even started getting smaller crests and there is an entire 'new' species called an English Budgie due to being twice as large and are more sociable towards humans, meaning they are easier to tame (befriend).<br /><br /> They are considered one of the top five best talking parrot species because of their largest vocabulary. Recorded budgie nicknamed Puck officially became known as the bird with largest vocabulary of 1700 words!<br /><br /> Budgies are easy to breed and maintain in captivity, making them avaliable in almost any pet store, therefore also making them way to underpriced which often leads to them being seen as same as toys and gifts for children and are not considered worthy of quality caring for them and expensive vet visits.";
